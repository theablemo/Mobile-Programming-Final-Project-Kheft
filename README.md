In this project, we created a mobile app using the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/) for the final project of the Mobile Programming course. In this app, anyone can sign up and sell their book, explore other users' books, and get contact information of sellers to get in touch with them.

# Setup
To use this project, you should have the Flutter SDK downloaded to your system. At the time you are running this project, some packages might be out of date or even deprecated, so it's good to keep that in mind.

# UI
The UI was designed with Adobe XD. You can see almost all of the designed UI pages in the [documentation PDF](<Doc/Documentation.pdf>), but the following are some of the examples:
